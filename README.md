# Sign-Up Form

## Overview
This is a simple sign-up form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes fields for user input, password validation, and a confirmation message upon successful submission.

## Features
- **User Input Fields:** Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, and Date of Birth.
- **Password Validation:** Ensures the password and confirm password fields match.
- **Radio Buttons:** Users can select their profession (Student/Employee) and agree to terms and conditions.
- **Form Submission Alert:** Displays a success message when the form is submitted.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling (linked as `index.css`)
- **JavaScript** for form validation and handling user interactions

## How It Works
1. The user fills in their details.
2. Password validation ensures both password fields match.
3. Clicking the **Signup** button triggers a success message.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser to test the form.

## Notes
